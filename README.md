# React Hertz ðŸ’¡


![Let a picture speak a thousand words.](docs/assets/blink.gif)

Hertz is a React framework (or reconciler/renderer) for driving hardware peripherals. **It projects the internal state of your React app to the physical world** instead of a [screen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom), [video](https://www.remotion.dev/) or [terminal](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink).

**NOTE**: Ihis is very much a work in progress. The docs are lacking, the API is not stable and tests are largely non-existent. However, you are very much welcome to play around with the project.

Curious or sceptical? Checkout the [soon-to-be blog post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0&list=RDxvFZjo5PgG0&start_radio=1).

## Quick start

You'll need some hardware to control. For now, Hertz supports the most basic peripherals for:
- [ClearCore](https://clearcore.ai/) - [docs](./src/bridges/clearcore/README.md),
- [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) - [docs](./src/bridges/arduino/README.md) or
- [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) - [docs](./src/bridges/raspberry/README.md).

However, it is very easy and more practical to write a bridge for your own hardware. See [Bring your own hardware](docs/bring-your-own-hardware.md) for more information.

Hertz needs to run **within a Node.js-like environment**. This means that:
1. Rasppbery Pi can control the hardware on the defice itself.
2. Arduino and other controlers incapable of running Node need to be controller from a computer (for example using a serial connection).
3. You cannot run it in a browser.
4. There appears to be no reason why Hertz would be incompatible with Deno or Bun, but we did not test this as of yet.

### Project Setup and Installation
We suggest starting with a typescript project within node and using `tsx` to run the code. Then, install Hertz (only installation from GitHub is supported ATM):

```
pnpm add react github:zigapk/hertz
pnpm add serialport # Only if you need to communicate with hardware over a serial connection.
```

Depending on your settings and package manager, you might also need to run `pnpm approve-builds` or similar.

### Writing a program

This starter program works on a Raspberry Pi and makes GPIO 17 pin blink (toggle from low to high every second):

```tsx
# TODO: needs rpi bridge to be implemented first
```

## Why use React to drive hardware?

TODO: address the questions below:
- why not (the leds in amoled example)
- clean code & safety
  - ease of programming
  - wrapping whole parts of tree in guards
- ecosystem (queries, ability to mount router etc)
- connecting web and hardware developers

## Important Concepts

Hertz has a few gotchas that we'd like to put forth here:

### Peripherals need to be leaf nodes
Hertz peripherals (tags) are leaf nodes in the React tree. This means that they cannot have children. For example, you cannot do this:
```tsx
<dpinout pin={17} value={true}>
    <SomeOtherComponent />
</dpinout>
```

### Peripherals might clash with each other
Depending on the peripheral type, you might encounter clashes if you try to control the same physical peripheral from multiple places in the React tree. This is no different from what happens if you overwrite a pin in a regular program (say C), but let's look at two examples nonetheless.

**Example 1**: Clashing and overwriting digital pins will result in one of them overriding the other.
```tsx
<dpinout pin={0} value={true} />
<dpinout pin={0} value={false} />
```

**Example 2**: Setting different pin modes might lead to hardware damage depending on the circuit connected to the pin.
```tsx
<dpinout pin={1} value={true} />
<dpinin pin={1} onChange={console.log} />
```

However, it might be completley fine to do this in some cases like reading from the same pin in different places, controlling different aspects of the same peripheral (say, whether a stepper motor is enabled and its position). This depends on the peripheral itself and bridge implementation.

## TODO

TODO:
- docs
- add arduino and clearcore bridges
- add ci
- expose this as a package installable from github
- event loop should allow for more controll
